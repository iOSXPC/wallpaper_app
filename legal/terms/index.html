<p>You should be aware that there are certain things which iOSXPC Design Studio will not take responsibility. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider; there is no guarantee that the app will work at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi and you don’t have any of your mobile data allowance left.</p>
<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi; you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider, the cost of data, for the duration of the connection while accessing the app or other third party charges. In using the app you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges; including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that you should receive permission from the bill payer before using the app.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, iOSXPC Design Studio cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app; i.e. you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the service, that responsibility will fall upon you.</p>
<p>With respect to iOSXPC Design Studio's responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although necessary measures are taken to ensure that the app is updated and correct at all times, third parties do provide information to so that the app can be made available to you. iOSXPC Design Studio accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
